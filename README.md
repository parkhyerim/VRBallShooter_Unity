# VR Ball Shooter  :basketball::gun:
a ball shooting game in VR 
<br>

## Project Title
**VR Ball Shooter**
* This game was originally developed in *Unity 3D* for use with *Oculus Rift* and *Oculus Touch* controllers.
<br>

## Motivation
* This ball shooting game was conducted in the user study for my bachelor thesis *"The effect of Extrinsic and Intrinsic Interruptions in Co-located Mixed Presence Environments"*. 
<br>

## Task & Features
* For this game participants shoot oncoming **yellow and blue balls** by clicking on their controllers with **a limited amount of time**. 
They have to click on **the left controller** to shoot the yellow ball and on **the right controller** to shoot the blue ball. 
Balls come randomly from the left or right side.

* There are **five ball shooters** from which balls pop out **at random**. 
The ball shooters are programmed with a script for shooting a ball once **every 1.5 seconds with a timer function**. 

* Game elements such as **animations, sounds, and a textual representation** of the current score and remaining time. 

* The **pause and resume** panel: the user can pause the game at any time.

* ### Hardware:
*Oculus Rift HMD, Oculus Touch controllers, Oculus Rift sensors*.

* ### Software: 
this application was developed in *Unity3D* which is a game development environment and engine and written in *C#*.
